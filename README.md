# All-in-One 5G

This project aims to run an all-in-one 5G system based on open-source projects, providing developers with significant convenience. 

Ultimately, this project aims to accelerate the development and deployment of 5G technologies by simplifying the development process and providing developers with the tools they need to innovate.

## A clean Open5GS

Open5GS is an open-source implementation of the 5G core network, designed to provide a flexible and scalable platform for deploying 5G services. 

This project offers a significant reduction in disk space usage for Open5GS deployments by optimizing the packaging of Open5GS components.

## A MongoDB for embedded device - Raspberry Pi and mini x86_64 machine

This project have recompiled MongoDB to be compatible with specific CPU architectures, making it suitable for running on embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi and mini x86_86 computers.
