# All-in-One 5G

This project aims to organize, compile, and run an all-in-one 5G system based on open-source projects, providing developers with significant convenience. 

Developers can easily access and utilize the functionalities of the entire 5G system without the need for complex setup or integration tasks. Ultimately, this project aims to accelerate the development and deployment of 5G technologies by simplifying the development process and providing developers with the tools they need to innovate.

## A Clean Open5GS docker image

Open5GS is an open-source implementation of the 5G core network, designed to provide a flexible and scalable platform for deploying 5G services. It offers support for both standalone (SA) and non-standalone (NSA) 5G network architectures, enabling operators and developers to test and deploy 5G networks in various environments. 

Open5GS includes components such as the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), the Session Management Function (SMF), the User Plane Function (UPF), and others, providing a comprehensive solution for building 5G networks.

This project offers a significant reduction in disk space usage for Open5GS deployments by optimizing the packaging of Open5GS components, users can deploy Open5GS instances more efficiently, saving valuable disk space while maintaining full functionality and performance.

## A MongoDB for embedded device - Raspberry Pi and mini x86_64 machine

This project have recompiled MongoDB to be compatible with specific CPU architectures, making it suitable for running on embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi and mini x86_86 computers. 

This customized version of MongoDB is optimized to leverage the capabilities of these platforms efficiently. By tailoring the compilation process to target the CPU architectures commonly found in embedded devices. This enables developers to deploy MongoDB-based applications on a wide range of embedded systems, unlocking new possibilities for data management and storage in IoT and edge computing scenarios
